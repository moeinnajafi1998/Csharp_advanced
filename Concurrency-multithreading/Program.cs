// Concurrency and multithreading in C# are essential topics for building responsive and efficient applications, 
// especially in scenarios involving parallel processing or asynchronous operations. 
// Let’s dive into each of the key areas:

// 1. Creating and Managing Threads
// In C#, you can create and manage threads using the System.Threading namespace. 
// Threads allow you to execute code concurrently, making your application more responsive and capable of performing multiple tasks simultaneously.

// Creating a Thread:
// You can create a thread by instantiating the Thread class and passing it a delegate (usually a method) that represents the code to be executed.

// Example:
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Thread thread = new Thread(DoWork);
        thread.Start(); // Start the thread
    }

    static void DoWork()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Work is being done on a separate thread.");
    }
}

// Managing Threads:
// Starting a Thread: Once a thread is created, you start it using the Start() method.
// Pausing a Thread: You can pause the execution of a thread using Thread.Sleep(int milliseconds), which blocks the thread for the specified duration.
// Joining a Thread: The Join() method can be used to make the calling thread wait until the thread being joined completes.
// Aborting a Thread: Although not recommended due to potential resource leaks and inconsistent state, you can forcibly terminate a thread using Abort(). However, in modern .NET, this is deprecated in favor of cooperative cancellation.
