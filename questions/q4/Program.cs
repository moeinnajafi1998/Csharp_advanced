// In object-oriented programming (OOP), including in C#, every object is characterized by three key concepts:
// state, behavior, and identity. 
// Let's break these down:

// State:
// The state of an object is represented by the data or attributes it holds, which are stored in its fields (also known as instance variables or properties).
// For example, a Car object might have fields like color, model, and speed. The values of these fields at any given time define the state of the Car object.

// Behavior:
// The behavior of an object is defined by the methods (or functions) it can perform. These methods operate on the object's state and can modify it.
// Continuing with the Car example, behaviors could include methods like Accelerate(), Brake(), or Turn(). These methods define what the object can do or how it can react to certain events.

// Identity:
// The identity of an object is what makes it distinct from other objects, even if they have the same state and behavior.
// In C#, every object instance has a unique identity, which is typically implemented via a reference (or pointer) in memory. This identity is what allows two objects with the same state and behavior to be recognized as separate entities.
